    "This tutoriel asume that you know how to use python language and you know how to install dependencies for the following sections.\n",
    " \n",
    " If you don't want to learn how **deep learning** works under the hood and you just want to learn how to use it, you can jump directly to the sections **4** to **5** \n",
    "## Definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Machine learning** is about defining the outcome and letting your algorithm learn the step to get here.\n",

    "**Deep Learning** is a subcategory of machine learning, it derives more precisely of neural network. The deeplearning consists to combine succesive layers of neural network.\n",
