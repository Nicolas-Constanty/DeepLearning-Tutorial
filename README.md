# Deep leaning tutoriel

## Introduction

This tutoriel asume that you know how to use python language and you know how to install dependencies for the following sections.
If you don't want to learn how **deep learning** works under the hood and you just want to learn how to use it, you can jump directly to the sections **4** to **5**

## Definitions

**Machine learning** is about defining the outcome and letting your algorithm learn the step to get here.

There is tree differents learning styles :
 * Supervised
 * Unsupervised
 * Reinforcement
 
**Deep Learning** is a subcategory of machine learning, it derives more precisely of neural network. The deeplearning consists to combine succesive layers of neural network.
